## Requirements

- Node 0.10.x
- Depenencies are chained together with NPM.

## Development

Database connection is through mongoose and can be found in Server/DB.js

Scope out Server/config for the meat of the server code.  There is no concept of username and password in this game - game codes are automatically generated and the first four people to hit the URL get to play, in order.

npm install
```
